Have faith in your dreams and someday your rainbow will come shining through.
The only way to get what you want in this world is through hard work.
How dare you? All of you, standing around deciding my future? I am not a prize to be won!
No, I will not stop. For every minute for the rest of my life, I will fight.
I want adventure in the great wide somewhere. I want it more than I can tell. And for once it might be grand to have someone understand I want so much more than they've got planned.
Our fates live within us; you only have to be brave enough to see it.
I'm a damsel. I'm in distress. I can handle this. Have a nice day!
There comes a day when I don't have to be princess. No rules, no expectations. A day where anything can happen. A day where I can change my fate. 
There's just no telling how far I'll go.
You said you'd trust Ping. Why is Mulan any different?
When the raindrops come tumbling, remember you're the one who can fill the world with sunshine
They can't order me to stop dreaming
You control your destiny - you don't need magic to do it
How about a girl who's got a brain, who always speaks her mind?
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty; I have whoozits and whatzis galore. You want thingamabobs? I've got 20. But who cares? No big deal. I want more.
If you walk the footsteps of a stranger, you'll learn things you never knew.
I'm like a shooting star; I've come so far. I can't go back to where I used to be.
If you keep on believing, the dream that you wish will come true.
If you dream a thing more than once, it's sure to come true.
Write our own stories, follow our hearts, and find love in our own time.
