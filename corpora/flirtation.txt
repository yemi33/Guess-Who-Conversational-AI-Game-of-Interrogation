Did you get dressed up for me or do you always look this good? 
You have a beautiful smile.
How does a girl like you stay single?
Do you look this good in the morning?
What does your boyfriend think of you talking to me?
Beautiful and witty, you’re the total package.
What’s your plan this weekend besides warding off guys trying to win you?
You must be pretty fast to outrun all the guys who must be chasing you.
How does a guy like me get lucky enough to get a girl like you to go out with me?
What’s your sign, open to a relationship or already taken?
Do you ever have a bad hair or a bad anything day?
I can’t decide what is more fun, hanging out with you at work or thinking about you after work.
You should spend less time at the gym and more time with me,you’re already perfect. 
You like to eat, I like to eat. Let’s try it together.
You make me laugh, you know that?
Your smile is like the sunshine, I want to look at it, but it is just too powerful to stare at.
If I had a dime for every time you brightened my day I wouldn’t have to work here anymore. 
I’m afraid if I wait any longer to make my move someone else will. 
If I had three wishes one would be to take you out, two would be to take you home, three would be to never let you go.
Is it annoying to have people stare at your beauty all the time?
