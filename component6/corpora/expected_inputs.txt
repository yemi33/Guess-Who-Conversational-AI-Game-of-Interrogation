I'm trying to interrogate you
I know you did it
You seem to be lying
I know for a fact that you're lying
Tell me the truth
Tell me exactly what happened 
Why don't you just come clean
What exactly was going on
I'm talking about you, not me
Are you sure you're telling me exactly how it happened
What are you thinking right now?
Why don't you just tell me the truth
I'm curious what's going on in your mind
Could you tell me what happened?
Why did you have to make that decision?
I'm sorry to hear that you felt that way
This is not excusable
What you did cannot be accepted 
No one has the right to take another's life
What were you doing that night?
Who is that 
What is that 
What does that have to do with anything we've been talking about 
Please stay on topic please 
Please go back to when you were explaining about that 
Why did you do that 
What was the reason for you doing that 
Where were you that night 
Where is that 
How is that 
Why did you that
